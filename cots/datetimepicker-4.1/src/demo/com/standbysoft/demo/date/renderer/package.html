<p>Contains classes that define a rule based date rendering system. The
big idea is to have a composite date renderer that will use a set of other 
renderers, each one of them rendering only a certain date aspect, to render 
a date.</p>

<p>THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PACKAGE THAT MIGHT BE ADDED IN THE JAVA DATE PICKER API 
IN FUTURE VERSIONS.</p>

<p>For instance, a date can have one or more of the following aspects: regular, 
trailing, selected, today date, disabled, weekend date, special, etc. If the 
today date is a trailing date that is disabled then it could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>painted using a gray foreground color to show its trailing aspect</li>
<li>red crossed to show it is disabled</li>
<li>with a red circle around it to show its is the today date</li>
</ul>

<p>Each renderer paints only a certain date aspect. This means that some
renderers will not render any date, only some of them. The composite renderer 
will ask all its aspect renderers to render a date and use its painting scheme 
to determine the final look for that date.</p>

<p><code>CompositeDateRenderer</code> is the composite renderer and assembles
a set of aspect renderers.</p>
